## Notes

- Question: What should we include in the thesis?
  - In chapter 1 Initial Situation write about what other schools have used, e.g. ETH used algorithms a and b, Edinburgh used algorithms c and d, and FSZHAW last year used bla bla
  - In chapter 2 theory write about the algorithms used by the schools briefly and the algorithms we use
  - In chapter 3 methods talk about the algorithms we are using and how we implemented them

- Algorithms
  - Pick which already have been used in other teams
  - Think about miscalculated cones (error rate?)

- Have an illustration ready for next monday about inputs/outputs
