## Notes

**What we have done:**

- Only small changes in Code, added some parameters to the Optimization Algorithm
- Created additional figures for Approach and Methods Chapter (Architecture, Optimization Package, V-Model, ...)
- Written sections about Scrum and V-Model, started with Optimization Algorithm and Architecture

**What we want to accomplish by next week:**

- Mostly finish Approach / Methods Chapter
- Test algorithms with Simulation Tool (with Luis tomorrow)

**Problems:**

- None

**General / Todos:**

- Will try to test the Path Planner Package with the Simulation Tool tomorrow
- Adjust V-Model figure, so it looks more like a V
- Figures on how the different objectives (algorithms) in Optimization work
- Project and Weekly Plan can be added to the appendix

- Add Verification and Integration Sections into Approach / Methods Chapter
- In Results Chapter
  - Difference between Optimization objectives (time-wise and more)

  - Describe Test Setup
- What has already been tested? What still needs to be verified? To think about next...
