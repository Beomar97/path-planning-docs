\section{Initial situation}
%\lipsum[1] \cite{quelle2}
There has already been done a lot of research when it comes to path planning algorithms. In the following chapter a limited list of implementation is presented in which it is distinguished between python and specific formula student implementations.

\subsection{Python Implementations}
PythonRobotics is a webpage and python library hub for different fields in robotics. It varies between arm, aerial, car robotics and many more.
In these segments of robotics it provides an overview of different algorithm implementations including path planning algorithms.
The path planning algorithms differ from different approaches for example a dynamic window, breadth first search, Dijkstra just to name a few.


\subsection{Formula Student Implementations}
