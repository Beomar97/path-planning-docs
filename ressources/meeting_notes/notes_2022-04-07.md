## Notes

**What** **we have done:**

- Chapter 2 Algorithms (wrote about RRT and Triangulation)
- Chapter 2 Formula Student (from Monika’s Input)
- Optimized the triangulation algorithm with less cones
- Created an “Input Transformer” in ROS (prepares cones and reference line for global racetrajectory)

**What we want to accomplish by next week:**

- Integrate global trajectory into ROS project
- Work on chapter 2

**Problems:**

- Finding a way to get the middle point with less cones on one side (not perfect yet à Demo)
