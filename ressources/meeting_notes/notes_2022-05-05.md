## Notes

**What** **we have done:**

- Extended Cone Publisher with Sim Tool compatibility, receives all track cones from tool and publishes these
- A lot of Code Refactoring, added Docstrings, Typings and many more improvements
- "Cache" for Exploration algorithm, takes only e.g. last 50 cones for distance measurements
- Working on "Switch" implementation, when to switch algorithms
- Optimization Algorithm with input from Exploration works now
- Added Path Smoothening for midpoints in Exploration Algorithm (Cubic Spline Interpolation)
- Extended Chapter 1 State of the Art Section with more examples
- Finished Algorithms Section in Chapter 2 (references and images)
- Started with Results

**What we want to accomplish by next week:**

- Write on Results
- Read other persons writings
- Refinement of Algorithms
- Compatibility with Simulation Tool
- Do "Work Overview" section in Chapter 1

**Problems:**

- None

**General / Todos:**

- Maybe use the Starting Position to know when to switch the algorithms, know when a lap is finished (Possible for Trackdrive)

- Getting Sim Tool working with Algorithms => Trying together probably better

  - Ask Gui how hard a local installation might be (Performance reasons on server)

- For testing, note down configs, make screenshots and more

- Feedback on Thesis (Detailed in PDF):

  - Sachlicher formulieren

  - Objektiver schreiben, mehr Bezug zur Arbeit und weniger zu Person

  - Nie Bild direkt unter Überschrift

  - Bild referenzieren im Text
