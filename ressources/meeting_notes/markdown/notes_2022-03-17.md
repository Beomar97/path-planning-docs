## Notes

**What we have done:**

- Chapter 1 "finished", will be extended if more sources are found
- Research of algorithms and literature
-  Found test tracks and created a plotter for those tracks
- First test implementation in ROS (simple cone publisher and planner subscriber)
- First Input / Output Model «drawn»

**What we want to accomplish by next week:**

- Implement and test algorithms implementieren (RRT / MPCC)
- Start with chapter 2

**Problems:**

- Difficult to find ideal algorithms (how to approach)
- Combining different algorithms (some teams have used Triangulation with RRT => how to approach?)
