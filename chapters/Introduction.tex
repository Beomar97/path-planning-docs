Formula student is a worldwide competition, where students are building a racecar which is either powered by a combustion engine or an electric motor. Several disciplines build the foundation for competing with each other. One of those disciplines is called driverless. Students have to develop an autonomous system so that the car could drive without a driver on the given track. Different components have to be implemented so that a normal car could work with the autonomous system. Path planning is one of those components which challenges the software engineer to program an algorithm which finds out the middle line and optimizes it. Some research has been made in path planning algorithms. In the following chapter, a limited list of implementations is presented, with these algorithms being distinguished between past theses, state-of-the-art implementations in robotics and in Formula Student teams all around the world. This chapter also introduces the reader to the Formula Student association of the \acrlong{zhaw} (\acrshort{zhaw}) called \acrlong{zur} (\acrshort{zur}).

\subsection{Related Work}

The Edinburgh University formula student describe the path planning and control for an autonomous race car by a see-think-act cycle. "See" means what kind of information the sensors and cameras provide. With "think", is the processing of the images, sensor data, mapping, localization and path planning. And "act" describes the mechanism to steer, accelerate and break the vehicle.

For path planning specifically two algorithms the A* algorithm and the \acrlong{rrt} (\acrshort{rrt}) algorithm have been used. In the DARPA Grand Challenge, all vehicles used a variety of the A* Graph Search Algorithm, with consideration of the kinematics. Furthermore, the incremental search algorithm \acrshort{rrt} was also used in the path in regard to autonomous driving.
To control the vehicle, another algorithm is used, the so-called \acrlong{mppi} (\acrshort{mppi}) algorithm.
\cite{path_planning_and_control_georgiev}

\subsection{State of the Art}
This section gives a brief overview of different implementation of path planning algorithms. We differ between raw Python implementations and implementations by other Formula Student teams.

\subsubsection{Python Implementations}
PythonRobotics is a Python library hub for a wide range of different implementations in robotics. It varies between arm, aerial, car robotics and more.
For these segments of robotics, it provides an overview of different algorithm implementations, including several path planning algorithms.
The path planning algorithms differ from different approaches, dynamic window, breadth first search, Dijkstra algorithm, just to name a few. 
\cite{python_robotics}

\subsubsection{Formula Student Implementations}
The first implementation of a path planning algorithm in the team of \acrlong{zur} consists of a middle line detection, path smoothening and a velocity / acceleration profile. To evaluate the middle line of the track, Delaunay-Triangulation was used. An error rate was considered e.g. when a cone wasn't detected. The implementation did not cover an algorithm which draws the optimum line in consideration of curves and speed. This is why research has to be made in optimizing the path. Furthermore, the complexity of the code has to be smaller so that future teams can improve on the work that was made.
\cite{autopilot_for_formula_student_jerome}

The \acrshort{amz} (\acrlong{amz}) the formula student team from \acrshort{eth} (\acrlong{eth}) have published path planning algorithms and other resources. Algorithms like the \acrshort{rrt} algorithm for track exploration and a \acrlong{mpcc} (\acrshort{mpcc}) for autonomous racing have been implemented. Furthermore, for easier software distribution, a skeleton for building and implementing driverless algorithms is provided.
\cite{amz_racing_github}

\acrshort{eufs} (\acrlong{eufs}) of the University of Edinburgh have developed a simulation tool on the basis of Gazebo which is the simulation toolbox for \acrshort{ros} and mantained by the same organization, Open Robotics. With the help of this application, a simulation of the race in the correpsonding to the real world is possible to a certain degree. The simulation was made to test the implementation of various path planning algorithms and other functionalities regarding a driverless system. One of the main feature of the program helps with the generation of a racetrack based on an image. \acrshort{eufs} also made pre-made CSV files available containing track information for the acceleration and skidpad track used in the Formula Student competitions. Various maps of trackdrive tracks are also provided.
\cite{eufs_sim_gitlab}

The \acrlong{tum} (\acrshort{tum}) houses a department named \acrlong{ftm} (\acrshort{ftm}), which developed an optimization algorithm for calculating the most optimal race trajectory of a given route. The algorithm takes a reference line (e.g. the middle line) as well as the distances to the track's borders as inputs and generates a preview of the calculated path as a plot besides the path itself. Additionally, an acceleration profile and the steering angle can be generated.
\cite{tumftm_optimization_algoritm}

\acrshort{fsds} (\acrlong{fsds}) is a community project, where multiple students from different Formula Student teams have worked on a simulation tool to test driverless system components. The simulation tool is based on Unreal Engine 4 \cite{unreal_engine} and has a \acrshort{ros} bridge to connect algorithm implementations to the simulation tool. It comes with pre-implemented tracks like Acceleration and Skidpad. Additionaly, other tracks, which are based on past competitions, are provided. These further tracks help the teams to test the algorithms with real world-like tracks.

\subsection{Formula SAE}
In 1980, the idea of a combustion engine asphalt racing competition was born at the University of Texas by Ron Matthews. Initially called the SAE Mini Indy Competition, it was later renamed to \Gls{formula_sae}. Today, there are many events organized by local associations worldwide.
\cite{formula_sae}
These competitions challenge teams of university students to build and participate with formula-style vehicles. They are held around the world and are one of the biggest student engineering competitions. As of today, there are approximately 600 teams. \cite{sae_student_events}

\subsubsection{Zurich UAS Racing}
\acrlong{zur}, formerly known as \acrlong{fszhaw} (\acrshort{fszhaw}), was launched back in 2019, with the first fully functional car finished in 2021. A new car is currently being built for the 2022 season, with more than 60 students involved. The new car has seen several improvements in aerodynamics, design, and most signifiant, with driverless capabilities. \cite{fszhaw_launch}
Therefore, for the first time in the association's history, the team will compete in the \acrlong{dc} (\acrshort{dc}) category.
The ability to localize itself on an unknown track and the ability to optimize a fully-known track are both critical components of a driverless race car. Therefore, it is important to research, implement and test various path planning algorithms. As part of the newly revised autonomous system, which also includes prediction, localization and controlling, a new path planning module has to be implemented.
The team will be competing at Formula Student events in Switzerland, organized by FS Switzerland \cite{fsswitzerland}, Germany, organized by Formula Student Germany \cite{fs_germany}, and Croatia, organized by FS Alpe Adria \cite{fs_alpe_adria}.
