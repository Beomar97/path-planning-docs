## Notes

**What** **we have done:**

- Testing/experimenting with Triangulation for the Exploration algorithm (see 'marcos-testing-reloaded'-branch)
- Started with the 'Output'-Publisher
- Finished section 'ZUR Autonomous System' in Chapter 2 Background
- Extended algorithm section in Chapter 2

**What we want to accomplish by next week:**

- Finish Implementation of the Exploration algorithm, or at least get a working prototype
- Add sections 'Work Overview' and add 'TUMFTM and U of Edinburgh' implementations to section 'FS Implementations' in Chapter 1 Introduction
- Improve BA thesis with feedback from Monika

**Problems:**

- None

**Todos:**

- After algorithm is finished, try to apply it to other tracks

  => Can use tracks from the Simulation Tool

- Consider the angle in front of the car if it could be a problem 

- BA Thesis Feedback

  - Introduction looks quite good
    - Add some more implementations from other schools (e.g. Edinburgh and Munich)
  - Background also pretty good
    - Explain/Show different tracks (e.g. Skid Pad, etc.) at the beginning of Chapter 2 Background
    - Maybe explain basic setup of ROS project (e.g. ETHZ skeleton?)
    - Pictures or figures for these algorithms
  - Methods
    - Later more into detail with triangulation and more
