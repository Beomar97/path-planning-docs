## Notes

**What** **we have done:**

- Optimized the triangulation algorithm with thresholds
- Integrate global trajectory into ROS project

- Created input transformer for global trajectory
- First test implementation for exploration with Delaunay
- Worked on Chapter 2 (FS Events and a bit about FSZHAW autonomous system)

**What we want to accomplish by next week:**

- Work on chapter 2
- Optimize Triangulation

**Problems:**

- Finding a way to get the middle point with curve detection

**Todos:**

- What happens when cones are missing? Will the algorithm still work?

- Maybe add virtual cones => As we know the width of the track

  After interpolation of the track, create additional points in between the "real" midpoints

- Send draft to Monika whenever we have something => Probably first version after easter weekend

- Wait with description of algorithms after they are prettty much finished and robust

- what happens if we see cones from the other side

- After track is known, even before the car is there => connect track to beginning (see screenshots)
