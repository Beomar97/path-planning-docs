## Notes

- Both Marco and Dan have completed the official ROS 2 tutorials

- Both have done some research into existing path planning algorithms and other works

  - Basic graph search algorithms
    - Dijkstra
    - A*

  - Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)
  - Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)

- Some interesting papers have been uploaded to the FSZHAW SharePoint

  https://zhaw.sharepoint.com/sites/FSZHAW2020-2021

- Next big step is to define the interfaces for both the inputs and outputs

  - Output will very likely be the next coordinate for the car to go to (probably the easiest and most preferable solution)
    - Still some restrictions apply
      - Distance of the car to the next point (e.g. 2m in front of the car) <- most likely be a config parameter

  - Input will probably be a list of the coordinates of the detected cones and the current position of the car (will be most tricky part)

- Need to think about what to implement and how to organize the nodes internally in ROS

- Resource Mgmt also important, computation needs to be quick of the path

- If we already want to implement something in ROS -> Draw a middle line of the path

## TODOs

- Think about the Input and Output
- Think about the architecture and how we want to organize the nodes internally
- First implementation in ROS possible -> draw a middle line
