When it comes to path planning algorithms, a lot of research has already been done. In the following chapter, a limited list of implementations is presented, with these algorithms being distinguished between past theses, state-of-the-art implementations in robotics and in Formula Student teams all around the world. This chapter also introduces the reader to the \acrlong{zur} (\acrshort{zur}) association of the \acrlong{zhaw}.

\subsection{Related Work}

Ignat Georgiev, a student at the University of Edinburgh, did a report on the topic "Path planning and control for an autonomous race car" in his master program. The report was based on the Formula Student project by the University of Edinburgh. The car follows the see-think-act cycle as an abstract way on how the path planning and control process is structured. By "see", he means what kind of information the sensors and cameras provide. With "think", the processing of the images, sensor data, mapping, localization and path planning is meant. And as for "act", the mechanism to steer, accelerate and break the vehicle is meant.

For path planning specifically, the report mentions two algorithms: the A* algorithm and the \acrlong{rrt} (\acrshort{rrt}) algorithm. In the DARPA Grand Challenge, all vehicles used a variety of the A* Graph Search Algorithm, with consideration of the kinematics. Furthermore, the incremental search algorithm \acrshort{rrt} was also used in the path in regard to autonomous driving.
To control the vehicle, another algorithm is used, the so-called \acrlong{mppi} (\acrshort{mppi}).

\subsection{State of the Art}
This section gives a brief overview of different implementation of path planning algorithms. We differ between raw Python implementations and implementations by other Formula Student teams.

\subsubsection{Python Implementations}
PythonRobotics is a Python library hub for a wide range of different implementations in robotics. It varies between arm, aerial, car robotics and more.
For these segments of robotics, it provides an overview of different algorithm implementations, including several path planning algorithms.
The path planning algorithms differ from different approaches, dynamic window, breadth first search, Dijkstra algorithm, just to name a few. 
\cite{python_robotics}

\subsubsection{Formula Student Implementations}
The first student in the \acrshort{fszhaw} team to work on path planning was Jérôme Perdrizat. The implemented path planner consists of a middle line detection, path smoothening and a velocity / acceleration profile. The work was done as part of his master thesis. To evaluate the middle line of the track, Delaunay-Triangulation was used. An error rate was also mentioned in the thesis, e.g. when a cone wasn't detected. The thesis did not cover an algorithm which draws the optimum line in consideration of curves and speed.
\cite{autopilot_for_formula_student_jerome}

The \acrshort{amz} (\acrlong{amz}) from \acrshort{eth} (\acrlong{eth}) made Formula Student driverless resources available in a public repository, which also includes implementations of path planning algorithms. Several algorithms are being mentioned, e.g. the \acrshort{rrt} algorithm for track exploration and a \acrlong{mpcc} (\acrshort{mpcc}) for autonomous racing. Furthermore, for easier software distribution, a skeleton for building and implementing driverless algorithms is provided.

\subsection{Formula SAE}
In 1980, the idea of a combustion engine asphalt racing competition was born at the University of Texas by Ron Matthews. Initially called the SAE Mini Indy Competition, it was later renamed to \Gls{formula_sae}. Today, there are many events organized by local associations worldwide.
\cite{formula_sae}
These competitions challenge teams of university students to build and participate with formula-style vehicles. They are held around the world and are one of the biggest student engineering competitions. As of today, there are approximately 600 teams. \cite{sae_student_events}

\subsubsection{Zurich UAS Racing}
\acrlong{zur} (\acrshort{zur}), formerly known as \acrlong{fszhaw} (\acrshort{fszhaw}), was launched back in 2019, with the first fully functional car finished in 2021. A new car is currently being built for the 2022 season, with more than 60 students involved. The new car has seen several improvements in aerodynamics, design, and most signifiant, with driverless capabilities. \cite{fszhaw_launch}
Therefore, for the first time in the association's history, the team will compete in the \acrshort{dc} category.
The ability to orientate itself in an unknown track and the ability to optimize a fully-known track are both critical components of a driverless race car. Therefore, it is imperative to research, implement and test various path planning algorithms. As part of the newly revised autonomous system, which also includes prediction, localization and controlling, a new path planning module has to be implemented.
The team will be competing at Formula Student events in Switzerland, organized by FS Switzerland \cite{fsswitzerland}, Germany, organized by Formula Student Germany \cite{fs_germany}, and Croatia, organized by FS Alpe Adria \cite{fs_alpe_adria}.

\subsection{Problem Definition}
\acrlong{zur}, the university's racing team, have begun their work on its second generation race car since Fall 2021. With path planning being an integral part of an autonomous car, the research and implementation of a new path planning module as part of their new autonomous system is very important. For further information, see the official problem definition in the appendix \ref{problem_definition}.

\subsection{Objective}
The objective of this thesis is the research and implementation of several path planning algorithms, which can be adapted on different tracks and driving scenarios. The end goal is to be able to compete in the \acrlong{dc} at various Formula Student events between July and August.
