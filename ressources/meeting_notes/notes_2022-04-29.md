## Notes

**What** **we have done:**

- Chapter 2 Section Algorithms finished (and added pictures)
- Done with "Exploration" algorithm implementation, a lot of refactoring and making it more clearer to understand
- Created figures for "Exploration" algorithm (Pseudocode and Flow-diagram)
- Finished PlannedTrajectory Publisher for the autopilot
- Tested "Exploration" algorithm with another, longer track => looks good!

**What we want to accomplish by next week:**

- Do "Work Overview" section in Chapter 1
- Combine Exploration with Optimization -> does it work together?
- Generally more Thesis writing this week
- Path smoothening
- Start writing about realization

**Problems:**

- None

**General / Todos:**

- Think about how to test the algorithms after they are finished

  ->maybe use manual points and calculate delta? whats the difference with real midpoints
